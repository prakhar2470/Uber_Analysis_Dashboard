Uber Trip Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
I recently worked on building a comprehensive Uber Trip Analysis dashboard in Power BI, designed to provide actionable insights into booking trends, revenue, trip efficiency, and customer behavior.
🔑 Key Features & KPIs Covered:
 ✔️ Total Bookings, Booking Value, Average Trip Distance & Time
 ✔️ Revenue trends across different time periods
 ✔️ Vehicle Type performance (UberX, UberXL, Uber Green, etc.)
 ✔️ Most Frequent Pickup & Drop-off Points
 ✔️ Longest/Farthest Trips for Demand Optimization
 
📊 Dashboard Highlights:
Overview Analysis: Focused on overall performance, including booking value, payment type trends, and vehicle preferences.
Time Analysis: Drill down into hourly, daily, and weekday vs. weekend booking trends to identify peak demand periods.
Location Analysis: Identified hotspots for pickups/drop-offs, supporting driver allocation and dynamic pricing strategies.

✨ Power BI Features Implemented:
Dynamic measures with disconnected tables
Interactive slicers & filters (Date, City, Trip Type)
Conditional formatting & tooltips for deeper insights
Export & reset slicer buttons for better usability.
📌 Key Outcomes:
 🔹 Identified peak booking hours & busiest locations
 🔹 Analyzed efficiency in terms of distance and duration
 🔹 Provided insights to optimize pricing models, demand forecasting, and customer satisfaction
